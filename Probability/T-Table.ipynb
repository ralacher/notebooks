This time they caught our friend whom we brought back to see the cannibals. Our friend is going to die unless we can show our statistically oriented chief of the tribe that there is not enough statistical evidence (statistical significance of 95%) to reject the hypothesis that he is a member of the tribe. Our friend was 185cm.  What does NHST say? Is our friend of the hook?"

The average survaivability is 4.7 years, which is much better. However the test was done only on 13 patients and this is a very expansive and invasive radiation treatment. Thus before wwe recommend it we should be very confident that it is worth the money and time(at least 99% confident). Help doctors with this decision."
